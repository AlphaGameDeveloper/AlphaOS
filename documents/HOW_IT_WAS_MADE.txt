How It Was Made
---

AlphaOS is a free, open-source, and pretty useless operating system from heck.  If there is anything that screams Linux, it's without doubt the command-line, and I believe that not many would disagree.

AlphaOS started off as a Docker container, and is still tested this way.  After that, slap on a Linux kernel, sprinkle a initramfs, and boom.  AlphaOS is written in Python, suprisingly.  AlphaOS started off as my pathetic attempt at a command-line (and it might still be) and then it spiraled to the piece of software that we... either love or tolerate.  I'll leave it to you.

AlphaOS was added to Git on April 23th, 2024 (commit e6be201), and it's code is on GitHub.
